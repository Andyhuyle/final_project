Dataset: RIPTA data
Research Question: How can we leverage patterns of RIPTA transportation to improve ride experiences?

Underlying Questions to Investigate:
1. Are increased delays observed on specific days of the week?
2. Do delays increase or decrease at specific times of the month?
3. Do delays increase or decrease at specific times of the day?
4. Are delays consistently observed at specific RIPTA stations across time?

Packages Required: 
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr) # to use %>%
library(readr) # to read excel file
library(lubridate) # to use as.Date function

Part 1:
- group_by Day.of.Week 
- create table and figure displaying number and percent of delays on each day of the week

Part 2:
- generate graph displaying number of delays per day and week May 2024

Part 3: 
- generate a new column for hour of the day using the mutate and positx functions
- create a graph to display the number of delays at each hour

Part 4: 
- group_by Stop.Number in ridership_simulated dataset and the stop in otp_simulated
- create table and figure displaying number and percent of delays at each stop

Simulation + Optimization: 
- simulate a day and month of RIPTA rides to determine the number of delays
- optimize the stations that require changes in arrival time
