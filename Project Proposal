Dataset: simulated RIPTA data
Research Question: How can we leverage patterns of RIPTA transportation to improve ride experiences?

Andy + Viva

Underlying Questions to Investigate:
1. What are ridership patterns across time?
hours, day of week, date
weekend vs weekday patterns
are delays tied to patterns in time?
What is the highest demand across hours, days of week, date of the time period provided	
	
2. Do delays increase or decrease at specific times of the month?
Is there a weekday cycle? 
Is there a monthly pattern? - might be affected by holidays (cinco de mayo, mothers day, etc)

3. What are the busiest stops?
delays per stop
boarding counts per stop
what is the fare distribution of riders?

4. What are ridership demographics?
what is ridership composition by hour and day
what is the distribution of demographics per stop
are specific groups riding when its less busy? (a person with a movement-based disability might choose to ride at a busier time of day?)

Packages Required: 
library(tidyverse)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr) # to use %>%
library(readr) # to read excel file
library(lubridate) # to use as.Date function

Project outline: 
Part 1:
- group_by Day.of.Week, hour of day across days, date 
- calculate count, mean, and percent of delays for each time period specified using the summarize function
- create table displaying count, mean, and percent of delays
- generate figures displaying (type of visualization not decided yet - we will have to see what organizes the data most appropriately when implementing) the number of delays on each time period specified

Part 2:
- calculate the number of delays per day using the summarize function
- calculate the number of delays per week using the summarize function
- generate graph displaying number of delays per day and week May 2024

Part 3: 
- generate a new column for hour of the day using the mutate and positx functions
- group_by hour
- calculate the number of delays per hour using the summarize function
- calculate the number of boarding counts per stop, per hour
- create a graph to display the number of delays at each hour of the day per stop (heatmap visualization?)
- calcuate the proportion of ridership fares reported at each stop per hour of the day

Part 4: 
- group_by Stop.Number in ridership_simulated dataset and the stop in otp_simulated
- calculate the number, mean, and percentage of delays at each stop using the summarize function
- calcualte the proportion of each demographic riding at a particular stop and time point
- create table and figure displaying number and percent of delays at each stop
- integrate demogrphic data into this figure to see if there is a trend?
- integrate p-value testing to determine significance 

Functions required:
- function to calculate ridership rates per time period
- function to simulate a day and month of RIPTA rides using given data
- scripts to process and visualize data

Simulation + Optimization: 
- simulate a day and month of RIPTA rides to determine the number of delays
- non-homogenous poisson process? (a guess not sure if this fits just yet)
- optimize the stations that require changes in arrival time
